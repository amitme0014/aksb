https cloning k liye developer settings mein jaa k personal token generate karna parta hai aur fir as a username and password 
add karna parta hai, jenkins mein... through this way it can clone.

SSH url cloning k liye, jenkins home directory mein jaa k public key ko as a cred save kar do...cloning k dauran public private key handshake 
ho jayega and it will clone the repo.
